/*
 * The Stability Pool holds BAI tokens deposited by Stability Pool depositors.
 *
 * When a vault is liquidated, then depending on system conditions, some of its BAI debt gets offset with
 * BAI in the Stability Pool:  that is, the offset debt evaporates, and an equal amount of BAI tokens in the Stability Pool is burned.
 *
 * Thus, a liquidation causes each depositor to receive a BAI loss, in proportion to their deposit as a share of total deposits.
 * They also receive a collateral gain, as the collateral collateral of the liquidated vault is distributed among Stability depositors,
 * in the same proportion.
 *
 * When a liquidation occurs, it depletes every deposit by the same fraction: for example, a liquidation that depletes 40%
 * of the total BAI in the Stability Pool, depletes 40% of each deposit.
 *
 * A deposit that has experienced a series of liquidations is termed a "compounded deposit": each liquidation depletes the deposit,
 * multiplying it by some factor in range ]0,1[
 *
 * Please see the implementation spec in the proof document, which closely follows on from the compounded deposit / collateral gain derivations:
 * https://github.com/liquity/liquity/blob/master/papers/Scalable_Reward_Distribution_with_Compounding_Stakes.pdf
 *
 * --- ATID ISSUANCE TO STABILITY POOL DEPOSITORS ---
 *
 * An ATID issuance event occurs at every deposit operation, and every liquidation.
 *
 * All deposits earn a share of the issued ATID in proportion to the deposit as a share of total deposits.
 *
 * Please see the system Readme for an overview:
 * https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/README.md#lqty-issuance-to-stability-providers

/*
* A sorted doubly linked list with nodes sorted in descending order.
*
* Nodes map to active Vaults in the system - the ID property is the address of a Vault owner.
* Nodes are ordered according to their current nominal individual collateral ratio (NICR),
* which is like the ICR but without the price, i.e., just collateral / debt.
*
* The list optionally accepts insert position hints.
*
* NICRs are computed dynamically at runtime, and not stored on the Node. This is because NICRs of active Vaults
* change dynamically as liquidation events occur.
*
* The list relies on the fact that liquidation events preserve ordering: a liquidation decreases the NICRs of all active Vaults,
* but maintains their order. A node inserted based on current NICR will maintain the correct position,
* relative to it's peers, as rewards accumulate, as long as it's raw collateral and debt have not changed.
* Thus, Nodes remain sorted by current NICR.
*
* Nodes need only be re-inserted upon a Vault operation - when the owner adds or removes collateral or debt
* to their position.
*
* The list is a modification of the following audited SortedDoublyLinkedList:
* https://github.com/livepeer/protocol/blob/master/contracts/libraries/SortedDoublyLL.sol
*
*
* Changes made in the Astrid implementation:
*
* - Keys have been removed from nodes
*
* - Ordering checks for insertion are performed by comparing an NICR argument to the current NICR, calculated at runtime.
*   The list relies on the property that ordering by ICR is maintained as the ETH:USD price varies.
*
* - Public functions with parameters have been made internal to save gas, and given an external wrapper function for external access
