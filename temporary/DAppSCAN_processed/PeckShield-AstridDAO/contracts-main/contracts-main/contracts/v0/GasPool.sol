 * When a borrower opens a vault, an additional 50 BAI debt is issued,
 * and 50 BAI is minted and sent to this contract.
 * When a borrower closes their active vault, this gas compensation is refunded:
 * 50 BAI is burned from the this contract's balance, and the corresponding
 * 50 BAI debt on the vault is cancelled.
